/* 
Q3. What are loops, and what do we need them? Explain different types of loops with their syntax and
examples. 
*/

/*
Loops are programming constructs that allow us to execute a block of code repeatedly until a certain condition is met. They are used to automate repetitive tasks.
The most common types of loops are:
For loop: It executes a block of code a specified number of times. The syntax is as follows:
for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
    // code to be executed
}
Example:
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    console.log(i)
}
In this example, the loop will run 5 times and print the value of i each time.
While loop: It executes a block of code while a specified condition is true. The syntax is as follows:
while (condition) {
    // code to be executed
}
Example:
let i = 0
while (i < 5) {
    console.log(i)
    i++
}
In this example, the loop will run 5 times and print the value of i each time.
Do-while loop: It executes a block of code while a specified condition is true. The syntax is as follows:
do {
    // code to be executed
}
while (condition)S
Example:
let i = 0
do {
    console.log(i)
    i++
}
while (i < 5)
In this example, the loop will run 5 times and print the value of i each time.

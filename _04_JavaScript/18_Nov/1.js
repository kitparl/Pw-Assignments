// Q1. What are conditional statements? Explain conditional statements with syntax and examples.

/* Conditional statements are programming constructs that allow the execution of certain code blocks based on specific conditions. They provide the ability to make decisions and control the flow of a program.

The most common types of conditional statements are:

If statement: It executes a set of code if a given condition is true. The syntax is as follows:


if (condition) {
    // code to be executed if the condition is true
}
Example:

python

age = 18
if (age >= 18):
    print("You are an adult")
In this example, if the value of age is greater than or equal to 18, it will print "You are an adult".Conditional statements are programming constructs that allow the execution of certain code blocks based on specific conditions.
